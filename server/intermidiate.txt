1.2 Problems and solutions 
Since this is the first meeting with the client, we wait our client to talk about the 
project. 
1.1 Functional requirements and Presentations in Last Meeting 
Our supervisor has distributed a project to us, which is about writing an academic 
writing suggestion website. It has used the NLP technique and basic knowledge 
about the online framework. 
Initially we had problem with what technique we should use in this project.  Later 
we checked in stack overflow  and  find out that we can use react as a  platform to 
control our front-end and Node.js can be considered as a back-end. For the machine 
learning part, we still need to check to our supervisor.
